<div class=perex>

We will learn how to write presenters and templates in Nette. After reading you will know:

- how the presenters works
- what are components and persistent parameters
- how to render a template

</div>


Life Cycle of Presenter
=======================

We know by now that a presenter action causes invoking `render<Action>` method, thus for example `renderShow`. But it's not the only method that gets invoked. When writing presenters, we can write the following methods:


[* lifecycle2.webp *] *** *Life cycle of presenter* .<>


`startup()`
-----------

Method `startup()` gets invoked immediately after the presenter is created. It initializes variables or checks user privileges.

.[note]
If you write your own `startup()` method, don't forget to call its parent `parent::startup()`.


`action<Action>()`
------------------

Analogous to the method `render<View>()`. There are situations when the presenter executes some specific action (authenticates the user, writes to database) and then redirects to somewhere else. To call it `render` would be inappropriate, because nothing is rendered. Because of that, there is an alternative called `action`.

It's important to know that the method `action<Action>()` gets called before `render<View>()`. It can even decide to change what render method gets invoked, by calling `$this->setView('otherView')` (`renderOtherView()` will get invoked).


`handle<Signal>()`
------------------

Method handles so called [signals |components#Signal (subrequest)] aka subrequests. Designed mainly for components and handling of AJAX requests. Processing of forms is also performed on this level.


`beforeRender()`
----------------

Method `beforeRender`, as the name suggests, gets invoked before `render<View>()` and it can contain for example setup of template, passing variables to template common for more views and so on.


`render<View>()`
----------------

Usually passes required data to templates.


`shutdown()`
------------

Gets invoked at the end of the presenters life cycle.

.[note]
More accurate would be to say, that we were talking about life cycle of the class [api:Nette\Application\UI\Presenter], from which presenters are inherited most often. In general, a presenter is any class implementing the simple interface [api:Nette\Application\IPresenter].


Termination of Presenter
------------------------

We can terminate a presenter anytime during its life cycle. We usually do this to prevent rendering a template.

- termination of presenter directly by method: `$presenter->terminate()`
- termination of presenter and immediate render the template: `$presenter->sendTemplate()`
- termination of presenter and dispatch of the payload: `$presenter->sendPayload()` (for AJAX)
- termination of presenter and dispatch of own response: `$presenter->sendResponse($response)`

A presenter can be terminated also by redirecting or by throwing a `BadRequestException`.


Templates
=========

The presenter will deduce the path to the template file from a few simple rules. It will try, for presenter `Product` and action `show`, if one of these files exists:

```
- templates/Product/show.latte
- templates/Product.show.latte
```

Presenter will also try to search for a layout (that is optional):

```
- templates/Product/@layout.latte
- templates/Product.@layout.latte
- templates/@layout.latte layout shared by multiple presenters
```

.[tip]
You can change the way of searching the templates by overriding the [formatTemplateFiles |api:Nette\Application\UI\Presenter::formatTemplateFiles()] or [formatLayoutTemplateFiles |api:Nette\Application\UI\Presenter::formatLayoutTemplateFiles()] methods.

Presenters and its components pass a few useful variables to the templates:

- `$basePath` is an absolute URL path to root dir (for example `/CD-collection`)
- `$baseUrl` is an absolute URL to root dir (for example `http://localhost/CD-collection`)
- `$user` is an object representing the user
- `$presenter` is the current presenter
- `$control` is the current component or presenter
- `$flashes` list of [messages |#flash-messages] sent by method `flashMessage()`

You can read more details about template rendering in a [separate chapter |/templating].

Actually it's not hard at all! When you're requesting an action, for example `Homepage:default`, then

1) an object of class `HomepagePresenter` will be created
2) method `renderDefault()` will be called (if it exists, but it doesn't have to)
3) template, for example `templates/Homepage/default.latte` with layout, for example `templates/@layout.latte`, will be rendered

and in template we can [create a link |#Linking] to mentioned `Product:show($id)`, roughly like this:

```latte
<a n:href="Product:show $productId">product detail</a>
```

It looks like creating applications in Nette Framework will be child's play.


Redirection
===========

There are two methods `redirect()` and `forward()` for jumping to another presenter, which have similar syntax as mentioned [link() |#linking]. For example, after submitting a form and writing to the database, we will redirect to the product's detail by calling:

```php
$this->redirect('Product:show', $id);
```

While `forward()` will pass to new action without redirecting, method `redirect()` will redirect the browser with HTTP code 302 or 303. If we would want to use a different code, we will put it before the name of the action of a presenter:

```php
$this->redirect(301, 'Product:show', $id);
```

To go to URLs outside of your application, you can redirect using `redirectUrl()`:

```php
$this->redirectUrl('https://nette.org');
```

Redirection immediately terminates activity of the presenter by throwing the so called terminating exception `Nette\Application\AbortException`.

Sometimes, before redirection, we want to send a so called [flash message |#flash messages]. That's a message that will appear after redirection in template.


Error 404, etc.
===============

When we can't fulfill the request, because for example the record is missing in the database, we will throw an exception `Nette\Application\BadRequestException`, which represents HTTP error 404:

```php
public function renderShow($id)
{
	$product = $this->model->getProduct($id);
	if (!$product) {
		throw new Nette\Application\BadRequestException;
	}

	// ...
}
```

When a user is not authorized to see the page, we will throw a `Nette\Application\ForbiddenRequestException` exception (error 403). Other error codes can be returned using second argument of `Nette\Application\BadRequestException`.


Flash Messages
==============

These are messages informing about a result of some operation. An important feature of flash messages is that they are available in template, even after redirection. Even when displayed, they are available for three seconds - in case that a user would unintentionally refresh the page - thus messages will not be lost.

Just call the [flashMessage() |api:Nette\Application\UI\Control::flashMessage()] method and presenter will take care about passing the message to template. First argument is the text of the message and second optional argument is its type (error, warning, info etc.). The method `flashMessage()` returns an instance of flash message, to allow us to add more information.

```php
public function deleteFormSubmitted($form)
{
	// ... model asks for deletion of record ...

	// we will pass the flash message
	$this->flashMessage('Item was removed.');

	$this->redirect(...); // and redirect
}
```

These messages are available in templates variable `$flashes` as generic objects, that contains `message` and `type` properties and they can even contain previously mentioned user-defined information. They can be rendered for example like this:

```php
{foreach $flashes as $flash}
<div class="flash {$flash->type}">{$flash->message}</div>
{/foreach}
```


Usage of Model Classes
======================

As we've said before, model is a whole layer composed of many classes, where each one is taking care of one part of application logic. If we'd have for example a model `App\Articles`, which would take care of loading and saving articles, we may ask for it in a presenter using Dependency Injection, assuming we've properly registered it as a service in DI Container.

```php
class ArticlePresenter extends Presenter
{

	/** @var \App\Articles @inject */
	public $articles;

	public function renderShow($id)
	{
		$this->template->article = $this->articles->find($id);
	}

}
```

What just happened? Let's go through it together. As we've said before, instances of presenters are created using the [PresenterFactory |api:Nette\Application\PresenterFactory] and what this class does after creation, is that it checks if the presenter has some public properties, that are annotated with `@inject` and if so, it tries to find a service that implements or is instance of the type, that is in `@var` and passes this service to the property from DI Container.

Thanks to this mechanism, we can use the service right away, without caring where it came from or trying to instantiate it, because we're sure that it will be passed to the property, as long as it's correctly registered in the DI Container.

You can only inject into public properties of classes.


Persistent Parameters
=====================

Except classic parameters, that we know by now, there are so called persistent parameters. Those are different in a very essential way: **they are passed through requests automatically.** That means, we don't have to explicitly mention them in links, but they are passed anyway.

When your application has multiple language variants passing the actual language in every link will be incredibly tiring. But that's not needed with Nette Framework. You can simply mark the `$lang` parameter as persistent just like this:

```php
class ProductPresenter extends Presenter
{
	/** @persistent */
	public $lang;

	...
```

If the actual value of parameter `$lang` will be `'en'`, the into the link

```latte
<a n:href="Product:show $productId">product detail</a>
```

the parameter `lang => en` will be passed automatically. Great!

But we can also add parameter `lang` and by that, change its value:

```latte
<a n:href="Product:show $productId, lang => cs">detail in Czech language</a>
```

The parameter will be accessible in the class variable `$lang` in objects of `ProductPresenter` and it can be accessed through `$this->lang`. We can even set the default value of the persistent parameter to presenter class. If the parameter value will correspond to the default value, it will not be passed in a URL.

.[note]
A persistent variable must be declared as public.

Persistence reflects hierarchy of presenter classes, thus parameter defined in specific presenter will be automatically taken into account in every single presenter inheriting from it.


Presenter and Components
========================

When we talk about presenters, then under the term [components |components] we usually mean descendants of class [Control |api:Nette\Application\UI\Control]. More accurate would be to use term "controls", but it has a different meaning in czech and "components" did better catch on.

Presenter `Nette\Application\UI\Presenter` by itself, is descendant of class `Control`, so there is major similarity between components and presenter. But `UI\Control` (and thus even `UI\Presenter`) is primarily a so called component container. Which means that you can add to it other components. Just like we add to [form |/forms/@home] inputs (text field, button, ...). And just like with forms, you can access them through brackets:

```php
// attach component to presenter
$presenter['mymenu'] = new MenuControl;

// get component from presenter and render it
$presenter['mymenu']->render();
```

Attaching the component to the presenter (binding them) you will be able to:
- create links in component
- use [signals |components#Signal (subrequest)]
- use persistent parameters in components

When you don't need any of these features, you don't have to bind the component with the presenter.


Component Factories
-------------------

Component factories are an elegant way to create components only when they are really needed (lazy / on demand). The whole magic is in implementation of a method called `createComponent<Name>()`, where `<Name>` is the name of component, that will create and return the desired component. This component is then attached to the presenter. The method `createComponent<Name>()` is optionaly passed the `$name` of the component, that is being created, as an argument.

```php
class DefaultPresenter extends Nette\Application\UI\Presenter
{
	public function renderDefault()
	{
		$menu = $this['menu']; // access to component
		// if this was the first access, method createComponentMenu() will be called
		// ...
	}

	protected function createComponentMenu()
	{
		// create and configure component
		$menu = new MenuControl;
		$menu->items = $this->item;
		// and return it
		return $menu;
	}
}
```

.[note]
The first letter of a component name is always lower case, despite that the first letter in the factory name is upper case.

Because all components are created in separate methods, the code is cleaner and easier to read.

We never call factories directly, they get called automatically, when we use components for the first time. Thanks to that, a component is created at the right moment, and only if it's really needed. If we wouldn't use the component (for example on some AJAX request, where we return only part of the page, or when parts are cached), it wouldn't even be created and we save performance of the server.

You can access and render component using [macro {control} |/default-macros#component-rendering]. So there is no need of manually passing the components to template.

```latte
<h2>Edit form</h2>

{control editForm}
```

You can read more detailed information about components on a [separate page |components].


Persistent Components
---------------------

Not only parameters, but also components can be persistent. Their state is then passed around when jumping to another presenter, just like with [persistent parameters |#persistent parameters]. We mark persistent components with this annotation (here we mark components `calendar` and `menu`):

```php
/**
 * @persistent(calendar, menu)
 */
class DefaultPresenter extends Presenter
{
	// ...
}
```

You don't have to mark subcomponents as persistent, they are persistent automatically.


Where Can I Get Some Components?
--------------------------------

On page [Add-ons, plugins and components |https://componette.com] you can find some open-source components that were made and shared by community of Nette Framework. Nette Foundation is not liable for them.
